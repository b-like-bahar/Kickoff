## Testing
- When adding new changes, make sure to analyze our existing end to end tests under `./e2e` and add the tests in the pertinent file or create a new file if necessary.

## Design System
- use the components inside ./components to construct UI when possible
- When creating new generic UI components, add a story to storybook which includes all possible permutations

## Database
When updating anything database related:
- Create a new migration file with only the necessary changes
- make sure to run `pnpm supabase:db:reset` so the latest changes are applied locally
- generate the latest types by running `pnpm supabase:generate:types`

## Notes
- Don't use interfaces in Typescript, use Type instead.
